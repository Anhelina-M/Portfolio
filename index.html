    <p>During Digital Media this year, I was able to meet so many new people, work on so many different projects, and learn so many technology based skills. I am so glad to be able to look at my past work and see my reflected effort. I'm really glad to be able to say that Mr. Zeng has helped me a tremendous amount of times whenever I was stuck on my projects, and I am mostly glad to look back and realize how much fun I've had in this class using cameras, Adobe, computers, GMetrix, etc.</p>
